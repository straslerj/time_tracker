# time_tracker
Time tracking program that will format output to be easily put into Gitlab. Feel free to **branch** and use it yourself!

#### Getting Started

 1. Clone this repository to desired folder.
 2. You may want to take note of this location, but it is not strictly necessary.
 
 *Note: if you move the batch file to be somewhere more convinient e.g. the desktop (recommended) be sure to update the path to the Python file to the full path.*

#### Starting the Timer
1. Either a. Navigate to the repository and double-click on `time_tracker.bat` or b. (if on Windows) open Start (`âŠž Win`) and type `time_tracker.bat` and run the application. You will likely have to use option (a) to begin.

2. Once running, the application is tracking your time. You do not need to do anything until you are ready to be done tracking your time.

#### Ending the Timer
1. Follow the instruction in the command prompt instance, which is simply enter `f` and then press `enter`.
2. You will now be given your time in a format that can easily be copied to Gitlab. <sup>[1](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/time_tracking.html)
3. Next, you will be prompted to enter the time you have left as a decimal e.g. 10.0 and you will be returned the number of hours you have left to work. This is likely valuable if you are referencing About Time to see how many hours you need. *Note: this part is not needed and you can feel free to enter any number - it won't change any other output*
